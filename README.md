## Projects

### Project 1: Real-time language translator

# Voice Translator using Python

This Python script is a voice translator that takes spoken input in English and translates it into the user-specified language using Google's translation API. Here's a breakdown of the script's functionality:

1. **Speech Recognition:** The script uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture voice input from the user.

2. **Language Translation:** It employs the `googletrans` library for language translation. The user is prompted to specify the desired language for translation.

3. **Text-to-Speech:** The translated text is then converted into speech using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library, providing an audio output in the selected language.

4. **Audio Playback:** The translated speech is played back to the user utilizing the `playsound` library.

Note: The script supports a wide range of languages, and the user can specify the target language for translation.
